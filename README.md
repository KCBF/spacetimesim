Made by Kody for Claude 4.6 Opus Hackathon Feb 2026

I built "The Cybernetics Simulation" to solve the fragmentation of deep time visualization; right now, there is no tool that lets you seamlessly scroll from the Big Bang through the Stone Age and into the future without losing context, so I engineered a continuous D3.js heatmap engine on a Next.js stack where the X-axis represents linear time and the Y-axis handles dynamic geospatial regions that morph linguistically and politically as you scroll—shifting from "Pangea" to "Gaul" to "Modern France." By grounding the past in a rigorous dataset of Wikipedia and scientific records while using a probabilistic math model to project the future post-2026, I’m effectively creating a "Long Now" chronovisor that democratizes access to complex causal chains, turning a macro-historical analysis that usually requires a supercomputer into a responsive, client-side web app that lets anyone visualize the entropy of the universe in a single, fluid viewport.
